# TeeTimeSchedulingApp
Create a daily tee time scheduling application for your local golf course to replace their call-in process for reserving tee times. The facility offers tee times every 10 minutes between 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM. To keep things simple, assume the facility begins each day with an open schedule and only allows for same-day bookings.
